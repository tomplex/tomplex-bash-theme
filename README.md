### Features

- exit code of last command

- current time
- show `$PWD`
- git integration: shows the current branch if you're in a git repo, and a green checkmark or red x if your branch has uncommitted changes.

### Installation

With `bash-it`, clone into `.bash-it/themes/tomplex` and edit your `BASH_IT_THEME` env variable in your `.bashrc` to read `tomplex`:

Otherwise, simply clone the repo and add `source path/to/tomplex.theme.bash` to your bashrc.
